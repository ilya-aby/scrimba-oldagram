## How It Works

The application displays a user interface similar to Instagram, showcasing posts of famous artworks. Each post includes the artist's name, location, avatar, the artwork itself, and a comment. Users can view the number of likes and interact with like, comment, and share buttons. The posts are rendered dynamically from a post object embedded in the script.js.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Scroll through the feed to view different artworks and their creators
3. Interact with the like, comment, and share buttons (purely decorative in this version)
